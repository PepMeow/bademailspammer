# bademailspammer
A really badly written email spammer, written in less than 2 hours. Originally written beginning 10:03 and ending 11:57 when with friends, made to spam a friend. Again, I am aware the code could be optimized in countless ways and is bad. However, it works and was really rushed. I am also pretty inenexperienced. 
Feel free to use the code if you want to (for some reason)?
Have a nice day!

to find smpt_server, use nslookup in your command prompt/terminal.
